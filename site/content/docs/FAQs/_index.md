### Answers

#### What is a Snapshot?

A `snapshot` is a [point-in-time backup](../features#backup-files-and-directories-using-snapshots) of your files/directories; each snapshot contains the files/directories that you can [restore when you need to](../features#restore-snapshots-using-multiple-methods).

#### What is a Repository?

A `repository` is the storage location where your snapshots are saved; Kopia supports [cloud/remote, network, and local storage locations](../features#save-snapshots-to-cloud-network-or-local-storage) and all repositories are [encrypted](../features/#end-to-end-zero-knowledge-encryption) with a password that you designate.

See the [repository help docs](../repository) for more information.

#### What is a Policy?

A `policy` is a set of rules that tells Kopia how to create/manage snapshots; this includes features such as [compression, snapshot retention, and scheduling when to take automatically snapshots](../features#policies-control-what-and-how-filesdirectories-are-saved-in-snapshots).

#### How to Restore My Backed Up Files/Directories?

Files/directories are restored from the snapshots you create. To restore the data you backed up in a snapshot, Kopia gives you three options: 

* mount the contents of a snapshot as a local disk so that you can browse and copy files/directories from the snapshot as if the snapshot is a local directory on your machine;

* restore all files/directories contained in a snapshot to any local or network location that you designate;

* or selectively restore individual files from a snapshot.

The [Getting Started Guide](../getting-started/) provides directions on how to restore files/directions [when using Kopia GUI](../getting-started/#restoring-filesdirectories-from-snapshots) and [when using Kopia CLI](../getting-started/#mounting-snapshots-and-restoring-filesdirectories-from-snapshots).

#### How Do I Enable Encryption?

Encryption is at the `repository` level, and Kopia encrypts all snapshots in all repositories by default. You should have been asked for a password when you created your `repository`. That password is used to encrypt your backups. (Do not forget it, there is no way to recover the password!)

By default, Kopia uses the `AES256-GCM-HMAC-SHA256` encryption algorithm for all repositories, but you can choose `CHACHA20-POLY1305-HMAC-SHA256` if you want to. Picking an encryption algorithm is done when you initially create a `repository`. In `KopiaUI`, to pick the `CHACHA20-POLY1305-HMAC-SHA256` encryption algorithm, you need to click the `Show Advanced Options` button at the screen where you enter your password when creating a new `repository`. For Kopia CLI users, you need to use the `--encryption=CHACHA20-POLY1305-HMAC-SHA256` option when [creating a `repository`](../getting-started/#creating-a-repository) with the [`kopia repository create` command](../reference/command-line/common/#commands-to-manipulate-repository).

Currently, encryption algorithms cannot be changed after a `repository` has been created.

#### How Do I Enable Compression?

Compression is controlled by [policies](../features#policies-control-what-and-how-filesdirectories-are-saved-in-snapshots) and is disabled by default. If compression is not working for a snapshot, it is likely that you have not enabled compression yet in your `policy`.

Enabling compression when using `KopiaUI` is easy; edit the `policy` you want to add compression to and pick a `Compression Algorithm` in the `Compression` section. Kopia CLI users need to use the [`kopia policy set`](..reference/command-line/common/policy-set/) command as shown in the [Getting Started Guide](../getting-started/#policies). You can set compression on a per-source-directory basis...

```shell
kopia policy set </path/to/source/directory/> --compression=<deflate-best-compression|deflate-best-speed|deflate-default|gzip|gzip-best-compression|gzip-best-speed|pgzip|pgzip-best-compression|pgzip-best-speed|s2-better|s2-default|s2-parallel-4|s2-parallel-8|zstd|zstd-better-compression|zstd-fastest>
```

...or globally for all source directories:

```shell
kopia policy set --global --compression=<deflate-best-compression|deflate-best-speed|deflate-default|gzip|gzip-best-compression|gzip-best-speed|pgzip|pgzip-best-compression|pgzip-best-speed|s2-better|s2-default|s2-parallel-4|s2-parallel-8|zstd|zstd-better-compression|zstd-fastest>
```
If you enable or disable compression or change the compression algorithm, the new setting is applied going forward and not reteroactively. In other words, Kopia will not modify the compression for files/directories already uploaded to your repository.

#### How Do I Enable Data Deduplication?

[Data deduplication](../features/#backup-files-and-directories-using-snapshots) is enabled automatically by Kopia for all repositories, regardless of whether you use the GUI or CLI. You do not need to do anything.

#### How Do I Change My Repository Password?

You must use Kopia CLI if you want to change your `repository` password; changing password is not currently supported via Kopia GUI. The [`kopia repository change-password` command](../reference/command-line/common/repository-change-password/) is used to change your password. 

Before changing your password, you must be [connected to your `repository`](../getting-started/#connecting-to-repository). This means that you **can** reset your password if you forget your password AND you are still connected to your `repository`. But this also means that you **cannot** reset your password if you forget your password and you are NOT still connected to your `repository`, because you will need your current password to connect to the `repository`.

Remember to select a secure _repository password_. The password is used to [decrypt](../features/#end-to-end-zero-knowledge-encryption) and access the data in your snapshots.

#### What is a Kopia Repository Server?

See the [Kopia Repository Server help docs](../repository-server) for more information.
