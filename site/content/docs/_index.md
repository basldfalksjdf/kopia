Kopia is a fast and secure open-source backup/restore tool that allows you to save encrypted snapshots of your data in remote or cloud storage, to network-attached storage or server, or locally on your machine. Kopia does not 'image' your whole machine. Rather, Kopia allows you to backup/restore any and all files/directories that you deem are important or critical.

Kopia has both CLI (command-line interface) and GUI (graphical user interface) versions, making it the perfect tool for both advanced and regular users. You can read more about Kopia's unique [features](features/) -- which include compression, deduplication, and end-to-end 'zero knowledge' encryption -- and learn more about Kopia's [architecture](advanced/architecture/) to get a better understanding of how Kopia works.

When ready, head to the [installation](installation/) page to download and install Kopia and make sure to read the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started/) for a step-by-step walkthrough of how to use Kopia.
