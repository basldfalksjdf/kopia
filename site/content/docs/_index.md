Kopia is a fast and secure open-source backup/restore tool that allows you to create [encrypted](features/#end-to-end-zero-knowledge-encryption) snapshots of your data and save the snapshots to [remote or cloud storage](features/#save-snapshots-to-cloud-network-or-local-storage), [to network-attached storage or server](features/#save-snapshots-to-cloud-network-or-local-storage), or [locally on your machine](features/#save-snapshots-to-cloud-network-or-local-storage). Kopia does not 'image' your whole machine. Rather, Kopia allows you to backup/restore any and all files/directories that you deem are important or critical.

Kopia has both [CLI (command-line interface)](features/#both-command-line-and-graphical-user-interfaces) and [GUI (graphical user interface)](features/#both-command-line-and-graphical-user-interfaces) versions, making it the perfect tool for both advanced and regular users. You can read more about Kopia's unique [features](features/) -- which include [compression](features/#compression), [deduplication](features/#backup-files-and-directories-using-snapshots), and [end-to-end 'zero knowledge' encryption](features/#end-to-end-zero-knowledge-encryption) -- and learn more about Kopia's [architecture](advanced/architecture/) to get a better understanding of how Kopia works.

When ready, head to the [installation](installation/) page to download and install Kopia, and make sure to read the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started/) for a step-by-step walkthrough of how to use Kopia.
