### Kopia vs Rclone

> Kopia and Rclone are not necessarily "competitors." Kopia focuses on allowing you to backup important files/directories to cloud storage. Rclone is a tool that allows you to move, copy, and sync your files/directories between different cloud storage. Rclone can be used to backup your files, but Kopia is designed to be a backup/restore tool and Rclone is designed to be a syncing tool. Kopia [supports Rclone as a `repository`](../repositories/), so you can use Kopia to store your backups in [all the cloud storage supported by Rclone](../features/#save-snapshots-to-cloud-network-or-local-storage).
